                    <p style="margin-bottom: var(--spacing-sm);">This room presents two histories that unfolded on the
                        same land but within different educational systems. One side traces the rise and decline of
                        Roger Williams University, a Black institution founded during Reconstruction to educate
                        teachers, ministers, and civic leaders. The other follows the development of Peabody College, a
                        white teacher-training institution shaped by Northern philanthropy and public investment.</p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: var(--spacing-sm);">These stories are presented side by side because they
                        were never separate in time or place. They were shaped by the same city, the same state and
                        federal policies, and the same legal boundaries of segregation. Yet access to land, funding, and
                        institutional security differed sharply.</p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: var(--spacing-sm);">Throughout the room, QR codes offer deeper
                        context—student voices, original documents, and moments of conflict and resilience that cannot
                        fit on the walls. Each QR panel stands on its own and can be explored in any order. Visitors are
                        invited to move back and forth between the exhibits, using these digital panels to explore how
                        education, race, law, and power shaped Nashville’s educational landscape.</p>
