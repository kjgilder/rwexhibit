These renewed educational efforts were led by John Yardley, a white man from Wilson County. When Yardley departed, his assistant teacher, Daniel Wadkis, took over and continued the classes. The first classes reopened on January 9th and operated discreetly, shifting from one location to another to avoid drawing unwanted attention.</p>" },

Plans were underway for the Nashville Normal and Theological Institute to begin with nearby Fisk University and Central Tennessee College. Within these institutions, the focus of education ranged from basic training to career development of ministers and teachers. By 1870, the Reconstruction efforts, including the Freedmen's Bureau, dissolved. Tennessee’s 1867 law was repealed, leaving new schools vulnerable.</p>" },

Sold in 1876, the building became the Knowles Street School and later the Pearl School. Hillsboro Pike: In 1873-74, Black businessmen Henry Harding and Abram Smith helped university leaders acquire 30 acres of the W.H. Gordon plantation between Vanderbilt and Belmont mansion. The university expanded the existing Gordon Home (renamed Mansion House) and built Centennial Hall.</p>" },

Most hailed from Tennessee and neighboring states. Many traveled from as far as Chicago, New Orleans, and Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). RWU offered instruction for three pathways: collegiate, normal (teacher), and theological. Courses included mathematics, sciences, languages, music, and vocational training.</p>" },

Fifty-six students filed formal charges against treasurer Theodore Edwin Balch, alleging unfair treatment, financial trouble, poor food quality, sexual harassment, and other misconduct. When RWU President William Henry Stifler responded with threats of expulsion, students appealed to the American Baptist Home Mission Society (ABHMS).</p><p>Historians view this incident as emblematic of the strained relationship between Black southern Baptists and their white northern benefactors among freedmen's schools.</p>" },

Women held faculty positions and comprised nearly 40 percent of students in normal school classes, reflecting the institution's progressive approach to educational leadership. Work-study programs and scholarships ensured that learning remained accessible despite the financial hardships many students faced.</p>" },

Du Bois and the Paris Exposition of 1900", contextPlaceholder: "1900-1904", galleryText: "<p>The 1899 class at RWU witnessed the momentous turn of the century. Their photos were part of the 1900 Paris Exposition, curated by W.E.B. Du Bois and Thomas J. Calloway. The exhibit showcased the history, conditions, education, and literature of African Americans in the United States. Data visualizations created by Du Bois and his research team were also part of the collection. The charts illustrate the growing importance of schooling and teacher training. This narrative likely resonated deeply with the RWU students and situated the university’s mission within the broader education landscape in the South.</p>" },

Attributed to a defective flue, it began during an evening prayer meeting and lasted until nearly 11 p.m. Some professors and most of the 225 students were left without shelter. On May 22, 1905, a second mysterious fire consumed the Mansion House. The fire occurred approximately one week after commencement exercises, so nearly all the students had vacated. Arson was suspected because residents of the dormitories heard suspicious noises. With both main buildings lost, the school was forced to close temporarily and plan for a new campus.</p>" },

This effort was led by Rev. William Haynes, who was born into enslavement to an enslaved mother and a white plantation owner. Upon emancipation, Haynes became a prominent educator, minister, and real estate developer in Nashville. As a leader in the Tennessee Negro Baptist Association and pastor of the Sylvan Street Baptist Church, Haynes worked closely with the ABHMS to transfer the university's incorporation to a new predominantly Black Board of Trustees in 1907. That fall, new dormitory and classroom buildings were constructed. The revived Roger Williams University officially reopened at the new location on Emancipation Day, January 1, and courses resumed on September 29, 1908.</p>" },

Educated during the university’s most vibrant period on Hillsboro Pike, Hill carried forward its values of education, civic responsibility, and social justice far beyond Nashville. As Roger Williams faced destruction, relocation, and eventual closure in the early twentieth century, Hill transformed the mission she developed there into decades of national civil rights leadership.</p><p>After relocating to Los Angeles, Hill became a pioneering public leader and community organizer. She co-founded the Los Angeles branch of the NAACP, served for years on the city’s Human Relations Commission, and advocated for fair housing, desegregation, voting rights, and equal access to public services. At a time when Black women were rarely recognized in public leadership, Hill helped shape civil rights policy on both local and national levels—extending the influence of Roger Williams into the heart of twentieth-century activism.</p>" },
                { year: "1929", wall: "Wall 3", title: "The Lasting Legacy of Roger Williams University", contextPlaceholder: "1929-", galleryText: "<p>In 1905, two fires destroyed Roger Williams University’s Hillsboro Pike campus. Rather than rebuilding, trustees sold the land, which was rapidly converted to residential property with racially restrictive covenants that barred Black ownership. In 1908, the university reopened on White’s Creek Pike under Black leadership, continuing to educate teachers, ministers, and professionals despite limited funds. Financial pressures ultimately forced its merger with the Howe Institute in 1929, forming today’s LeMoyne-Owen College.</p><p>Though its original campus no longer stands, the legacy of Roger Williams University lives on through alumni leaders like Rebecca Jane Perkins Hill and many others who carried its mission into communities, courtrooms, churches, and city halls across the nation.</p>" }
